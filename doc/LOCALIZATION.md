# Localization

From `common/` run

```bash
pub run intl_translation:generate_from_arb --output-dir=lib/src/i18n/generated lib/src/i18n/string.dart lib/src/i18n/translations/cs_CZ.arb lib/src/i18n/translations/en_US.arb
```

or

```bash
pub run intl_translation:extract_to_arb --output-dir=lib/src/i18n/translations lib/src/i18n/flashcards_strings.dart
```

## How to

So, you have just added some string to program, let's say it's `TextBox("Hello world.")`.
First of all, don't use simple string (`"Hello world."`), instead use `FlashcardsStrings.of(context).<name>()`.
`FlashcardsStrings` is imported class from file `FlashcardsStrings.dart`, `of(context)` is just method that returns complete dictionary based on language stored in `BuildContext context` passed as parameter and `<name>()` is name of *Template*.
Ok, so now you have `TextBox(FlashcardsStrings.of(context).HelloWorld())`, you have to add `HelloWorld()` template to `FlashcardsString.dart` file according to [Intl](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/intl#messages) reference.
Add this to `FlashcardsString.dart` file:

```dart
  String HelloWorld() {
    return Intl.message(
      'Hello world',
      name: 'hello_world',
      desc: 'Example text',
      locale: _localeName,
    );
  }
```

Now just look at *Method two*, run these commands and everything should work.

### Method one: I've just translated something

Oh, you are a such a great guy, here, have some :cookie:
Now let's get to the business. So you have just edited some of the flashcards_\<lang\>.arb files.
Run in console this line (while your operating folder is root of flutter app, otherwise you will get `missing pubspec.yaml` error) and execute this command:

`flutter pub pub run intl_translation:generate_from_arb --output-dir=lib/i18n/generated --generated-file-prefix=flashcards_ lib/*/*.dart ../common/lib/i18n/flashcards_*.arb`

PS: if you've changed just one file, change `common/lib/i18n/generated/flashcards_*.arb` to `common/lib/i18n/generated/flashcards_<lang>.arb`, lang according to the file you've changed.

### Method two: I've added some templates

Then just simply run

`flutter pub pub run intl_translation:extract_to_arb --output-dir=../common/lib/i18n lib/*/*.dart`

And It'll generate new `intl_messages.arb` file. Now just copy changes to `flashcards_<lang>.arb`, translate it and continue on *Method one*.

## Edit disclaimer

Do NOT edit file `FlashcardsDelegate.dart` unless you know exactly what are you are doing.
Do NOT edit file `FlashcardsStrings.dart` unless you know exactly what are you are doing, or you are adding new generation template (End of the `FlashcardsStrings` class).

## So what it is and how to use it

`FlashcardsDelegate.dart` is file that is responsible for loading localizations and according files to that.

`FlashcardsStrings.dart` contains class which stores all localized values.
At the end of this class are `String` returning methods, these serves for two purposes.

1. They act as a template while generating `.arb` files for translations.
2. They are getters of localized strings.

More about these methods in [Intl](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/intl#messages) documentation.

Folder `generated` contains all generated files. Do NOT edit any of these files, except `flashcards_<lang>.arb`.

In file `generated/intl_messages.arb` is template, how `flashcards_<lang>.arb` should look like, except for the localized string of course.
